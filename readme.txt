To use the Plugin Manager to install this component.

from http://on.tapogee.com. Obviously skip this step 
if you've already installed the framework. 

STEP 2: Navigate to your Plugin Manager index page 
located at http://[ontap]/admin/plugins. Select the 
tab labelled "more" and use the provided form to 
upload the zip archive into your application. [1] 

STEP 3: Accept the licensing agreement. 

STEP 4: You'll be presented with a form to configure 
the plugin. When you submit the configuration form, the 
installer will begin installing files for your application. 

STEP 5: You're done! Once the plugin is installed 
you will be returned to the Plugin Manager index. 

[Footnotes]
[1] If you have problems with the upload form, you 
can unzip the plugin manually into the Plugin Manager 
source directory. 

By default the source directory is located at 
[ontap]/_tap/admin/plugins/source 

The root /transfer/ directory in the zip archive should 
be directly underneath the plugin source directory, i.e. 
[ontap]/_tap/admin/plugins/source/transfer
